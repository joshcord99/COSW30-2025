    <?php
        echo "<p>This week, we learned how to create a basic format using PHP, HTML, and CSS. We also covered various PHP syntax concepts. For my project, I built a site introducing myself, including my hobbies and goals, using PHP. It was easy to create the site with basic HTML and CSS since I had experience with them before.</p>";

        echo "<p>One challenge I faced was knowing what needed to be wrapped in PHP tags. However, after looking into it, I was able to figure it out. I didn’t really have any 'A-HA' moments, but my past experience from bootcamp helped me apply what I already knew about HTML and CSS. This project also added another piece to my portfolio, showcasing my skills and my early journey with PHP.</p>";

        echo "<p>I think getting more comfortable with PHP syntax and understanding the proper setup for calling HTML within a PHP file would be beneficial. Since I struggled with knowing when to use <code>echo</code> in PHP, I turned to Stack Overflow for help. I love using Stack Overflow because it’s a community where programmers from different backgrounds can help each other.</p>";

    <?php
        echo "<p>Looking back on this week, I learned more about using PHP with HTML. I’m pretty comfortable with HTML, but making sure my PHP syntax was correct was tricky. I had to check W3Schools and Stack Overflow a lot to figure out where to place <code>echo</code> statements and how to make sure my pages worked together. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23104978/php-echo-statement-position-and-styling-control?'>Here was a helpful Stack Overflow post</a> on placing echo statements, and <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18243598/controlling-location-of-php-echo-statement?'>another one</a> about controlling where they show up.</p>";

        echo "<p>One of the hardest things was making sure I echoed the right information at the right time and handling data across multiple pages. I also got stuck on setting up a table, but after thinking it through, I realized the answer was pretty simple.</p>";

        echo "<p>My bootcamp experience really helped, and I try to use that knowledge whenever I can. I was proud that I built a full site exactly how I wanted without taking shortcuts.</p>";

        echo "<p>One thing I need to work on is giving myself more time for projects so I don’t have to lock in so hard. Using resources like Stack Overflow and W3Schools helped a lot by giving me different ways to solve problems and making sure my syntax was right.</p>";

    <!-- <img class="pictures" src="assets/in-n-out.png" alt="Week 4 Image"> -->
    <?php
        echo "<p>This week, I learned how to iterate over an array and display it on the front page. One of my biggest 'aha' moments was figuring out how to properly loop through an array and append the elements to a webpage. It was satisfying to not only understand the process but also successfully implement it in my application. I also realized that I can improve the readability of my code by using clean, well-structured variable names. Writing clear and maintainable code is something I want to focus on moving forward.</p>";
    ?>

    <h2 class="weeks">Week 6: March 24, 2025</h2>
    <img class="pictures" src="assets/zila.png" alt="Week 6 Image">
    <?php
        echo "<p>This week, I learned tools like FileZilla, which are used when working with databases and file transfers. One of my biggest 'aha' moments was during class while setting up FileZilla. At first, I was confused and unsure about the process, but eventually, the concept clicked. That was the most challenging part of the week, but I enjoy a challenge—it pushes me to grow and get better. I also realized the importance of taking time to understand each step, especially when working with system tools like FileZilla. Moving forward, I want to build more confidence in using these tools and get a deeper understanding of how they work behind the scenes.</p>";

    <h2 class="weeks">Week 7: March 24, 2025</h2>
    <img class="pictures" src="assets/zila.png" alt="Week 7 Image">
    <?php
    echo "<p>This week, I learned how to use the <code>phpinfo()</code> function to view my PHP environment. I created a <code>phpinfo.php</code> file and uploaded it using FileZilla to my site’s <code>public_html</code> folder.</p>";

    echo "<p>At first, I wasn’t sure where to upload the file, but once I found the right directory, everything worked. It was cool to see all the server settings and installed modules.</p>";

    echo "<p>My bootcamp experience helped with writing the PHP code, but I still used online resources to double-check my syntax.</p>";

    echo "<p>Next time, I want to get faster at navigating the server and organizing files better.</p>";
